## IMPORTANT

If you are looking for the code for papers _"SPARQL as a Foreign Language"_ and _"Neural Machine Translation for Query Construction and Composition"_ please checkout tag [v0.1.0-akaha](https://github.com/LiberAI/NSpM/tree/v0.1.0-akaha) or branch [v1](https://github.com/LiberAI/NSpM/tree/v1).

## Install

### Via pip

Coming soon!

### Local setup

Clone the repository.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example of usage

### The Generator module

#### Pre-generated data

You can extract pre-generated data and model checkpoints from [here](https://nspm-models.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/v2/art_30.zip) (1.1 GB) in folders having the respective names.

#### Manual Generation (Alternative to using pre-generated data)

The template used in the paper can be found in a file such as `Annotations_F30_art.csv`. `data/art_30` will be the ID of the working dataset used throughout the tutorial. To generate the training data, launch the following command.

```bash
mkdir -p data/art_30
python nspm/generator.py --templates data/templates/Annotations_F30_art.csv --output data/art_30
```

Launch the command if you want to build dataset seprately else it will internally be called while training.

```bash
python nspm/data_gen.py --input data/art_30 --output data/art_30
```

### The Learner module

Now go back to the initial directory and launch `learner.py` to train the model. 

```bash
python nspm/learner.py --input data/art_30 --output data/art_30
```

This command will create a model checkpoints in `data/art_30` and some pickle files in `data/art_30/pickle_objects`.

### The Interpreter module

Predict the SPARQL query for a given question it will store the detailed output in output_query.

```bash
python nspm/interpreter.py --input data/art_30 --output data/art_30 --query "yuncken freeman has architected in how many cities?"
```
or, if you want to use NSpM with [airml](https://github.com/sahandilshan/airML) to install pre-trained models, follow these steps,
1. Install airML latest version from [here](https://pypi.org/project/airML/)
2. Navigate to the table.kns [here](https://github.com/sahandilshan/KBox/blob/dev/kns/2.0/table.kns) and check if your model is listed in that file.
3. Then copy the name of that model and use it with the `interpreter.py` as follows
```bash
python interpreter.py --airml http://nspm.org/art --output data/art_30 --inputstr "yuncken freeman has architected in how many cities?"
```

## Use cases & integrations

* Components of the [Adam Medical platform](https://www.graphen.ai/products/mi_feature.html) partly developed by [Jose A. Alvarado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josealvaradoguzman/) at Graphen (including a humanoid robot called Dr Adam), rely on NSpM technology.
* The [Telegram NSpM chatbot](https://github.com/AKSW/NSpM/wiki/NSpM-Telegram-Bot) offers an integration of NSpM with the Telegram messaging platform.
* The [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program has been supporting 6 students to work on NSpM-backed project "[A neural question answering model for DBpedia](https://github.com/dbpedia/neural-qa)" since 2018.
* A [question answering system](https://github.com/qasim9872/question-answering-system) was implemented on top of NSpM by [Muhammad Qasim](https://github.com/qasim9872).
